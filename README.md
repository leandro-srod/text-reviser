# TEXT REVISER ✨(ALURA ROADMAP - Stage 2 ✨)

## Project Description

Following the Alura Roadmap, now in stage 2, i was able to study the possibilities of JavaScript together with Nodejs to build a text review application. This app allows the read of pre-select texts, showing the words repeated in each paragraph.Furthermore, the Chalk and Commander libraries were incorporated to facilitate the commands in the terminal, as well as the functionality of creating a file with the results for each text. In this development, i was able to practice and apply several concepts, such error handling (try / catch), incorporation of functions (import / export / require) asynchronous code (promises).

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies:

* **JavaScript (ES6+):**
* **Nodejs**
